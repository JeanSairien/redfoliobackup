# Red-Folio
Welcome to my redfolio 


### Setup
		The "index.php" must be open here, I'm sorry that I used an include, but I've asked Mr. Duclos to use them. I didn't want to lose anytime to add  a navbar and a footer again and again.
		
In the index we have :

I used bootstrap for the carrousel, the navbar and any elements I thought usefull

* Bootstrap :
 			one page "bootstrap.php" with a part of my initiating bootstrap lexicon in a iframe (sorry about that) and a link to the full page lexicon

* Kali linux : a page is comming like winter

* Php 7 : another page is comming 



## Comments
